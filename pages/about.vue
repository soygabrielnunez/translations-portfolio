        My name is Julio César "Bango" Colmenares, and I am a JP>ENG localizer that works mainly in the video game/visual novel space, though I do have experience in with light novel and manga as well.
        Bringing stories over and helping audiences experience works of fiction with the same intensity and passion as their original audiences is my vocation in life, and I am always looking
        to expand my range as a writer and and translator.
        I'm always open to new experiences and learning, for the art of translation is a never-ending road that I'm very glad to call my profession.
